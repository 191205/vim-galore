#### Managing plugins

[Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) was the first popular tool for
managing plugins. Actually it just adjusts the _runtimepath_ (`:h 'rtp'`) to
include all the things put under a certain directory. You have have to clone the
repositories of the plugins there yourself.

Real plugin managers expose commands that help you installing and updating
plugins from within Vim. Hereinafter is a list of commonly used plugin managers
in alphabetic sequence:

- [neobundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim)
- [plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
- [vim-addon-manager](https://github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-manager)
- [vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)

Plug is my favorite, but your mileage may vary.
